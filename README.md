These repos may be quite old and probably no longer work at all. I have no idea.
Yes I am still active but mostly in private [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sam_krekeny) repos.
If you're looking for something current from me, check out [@Krekeny](https://krekeny.com) or [@eny.social](https://bsky.app/profile/eny.social).
